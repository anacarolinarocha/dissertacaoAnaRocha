This kind of information is vital to fundamental aspects of national governmental administration such as short, medium and long term planning and taxation. As the number of possible categories considered is very large (more than 1000 in the Brazilian scenario), the automatic text categorization problem targeted here is quite challenging. We have applied and compared the use of two different techniques to deal with it: the Vector Space Model in its classical form to represent the texts, and VG-RAM, a Weightless Neural Network.},

However, in such representation synonyms and/or related terms are treated as independent. Furthermore, there are some terms that do not add any information at all to the set of text documents, on the contrary they even might harm the performance of the information retrieval techniques. In an attempt to reduce this problem, some techniques have been proposed in the literature. In this work we present a method to tackle this problem. In order to validate our approach, we carried out a serie of experiments on four databases and we compare the achieved results with other well known techniques. The evaluation results is such that our method obtained in all cases a better or equal performance compared to the other literature techniques.},

With the the explosive growth of data, the method of SVM with ordinal partitioning called SVMOP highlights its advantages due to its convenience of dealing with large scale data. However, the method of SVMOP for ordinal regression has not been exploited much. As we know, the costs should be di erent when dealing with mislabeled samples and how to use them plays a dominant role in model building. However, L2-loss which could enlarge the cost sensitivity has not been applied into SVM ordinal partition yet. In this paper, we propose the method of SVMOP with L2-loss for ordinal regression. Numerical results show that our approach outperforms the method of SVMOP with L1-loss and other ordianl regression models.},

Further decision stump is selected as the weak learner of the AdaBoost algorithm for classification. The comparison of simulation results between conventional AdaBoost and the method proposed in this paper shows that the proposed algorithm has improved testing accuracy of the data sets with the noisy data.},

This paper focuses on mislabeled data, which is one of the main types of noisy data. A number of mislabeled data detection techniques have been proposed; however, there is no survey work to summarize those techniques. This paper reviews the existing studies and classifies them into three types: Local learning-based, ensemble learning-based, and single learning-based methods.

On this document collection, we studied three different multilabel classification problems, the largest being the categorization into the EUROVOC concept hierarchy with almost 4000 classes. We evaluated three algorithms: (i) the binary relevance approach which independently trains one classifier per label; (ii) the multiclass multilabel perceptron algorithm, which respects dependencies between the base classifiers; and (iii) the multilabel pairwise perceptron algorithm, which trains one classifier for each pair of labels. All algorithms use the simple but very efficient perceptron algorithm as the underlying classifier, which makes them very suitable for large-scale multilabel classification problems. The main challenge we had to face was that the almost 8,000,000 perceptrons that had to be trained in the pairwise setting could no longer be stored in memory. We solve this problem by resorting to the dual representation of the perceptron, which makes the pairwise approach feasible for problems of this size. The results on the EUR-Lex database confirm the good predictive performance of the pairwise approach and demonstrates the feasibility of this approach for large-scale tasks.},

It is the responsibility of the data analyst to formulate the scientific issue at hand in terms of PC projections, PLS regressions, etc. Ask yourself, or the investigator, why the data matrix was collected, and for what purpose the experiments and measurements were made. Specify before the analysis what kinds of patterns you would expect and what you would find exciting.The results of the analysis depend on the scaling of the matrix, which therefore must be specified. Variance scaling, where each variable is scaled to unit variance, can be recommended for general use, provided that almost constant variables are left unscaled. Combining different types of variables warrants blockscaling.In the initial analysis, look for outliers and strong groupings in the plots, indicating that the data matrix perhaps should be {\textquotedblleft}polished{\textquotedblright} or whether disjoint modeling is the proper course.For plotting purposes, two or three principal components are usually sufficient, but for modeling purposes the number of significant components should be properly determined, e.g. by cross-validation.Use the resulting principal components to guide your continued investigation or chemical experimentation, not as an end in itself.},

As it requires expertise in law, statistics, and computer science, jurimetrics is a multidisciplinary field. When trying to implement a jurimetric system in Brazil, additional challenges were identified due to the heterogeneity of the different court systems, the lack of standards, and how the open data laws in Brazil are interpreted and implemented. In this article, we present a survey of Brazilian courts in terms of readiness to implement a jurimetric system. Analyzing a sample of data, we have found, in light of Brazil’s open data regulation, privacy issues and technical issues.

This study will help readers acquire the necessary information about these elements and their associated techniques. Thus, we believe that this study will assist other researchers and professionals to propose new studies in the field of text classification.},

	abstract = {Os Agravos foram inseridos na legislação pátria após a proclamação da Independência, em decorrência do advento da lei de 20 de outubro de 1823, a qual declarava em vigor a legislação que regeu o Brasil até 25.04.1821, sendo que, neste curso, foram modificadas e alteradas por diversas vezes, com o escopo de garantir a celeridade do processo. O Código de Processo Civil de 1939, consagrou o Agravo de Petição com especificidades, e o distingui em relação às demais formas de agravo. Atualmente, o Agravo de Petição é uma das opções de recurso nos trâmites processuais trabalhistas, que tem como finalidade impugnar as decisões definitivas de execução - diferentemente do Agravo de Instrumento, que é o recurso cabível da decisão do juiz que negou recursos interpostos pela parte. O Agravo de Petição visa rediscutir a penhora e os cálculos da liquidação, e deverá ser efetuado no prazo especifico do artigo 897, alínea “a” da CLT : “ Cabe agravo, no prazo de 8 (oito) dias: a) de petição, das decisões do Juiz ou Presidente, nas execuções”. Ainda, deve ser necessário que se delimite, justificadamente, os valores e a matéria objetos do recurso, fazendo uma minuciosa e detalhada explicação do seu inconformismo. Para que surta seus efeitos, deverão ser observados os pressupostos processuais e os requisitos de admissibilidade quanto à matéria, valores e os fundamentos da decisão, os quais serão analisados pelo juiz, abrindo-se vista à parte contrária para contrapor. Nos termos da lei, tem efeito suspensivo porque, ao ser interposto, já existe penhora e ainda que ao apelo seja atribuído efeito apenas devolutivo, a execução será provisória e, assim, não poderá ir além da penhora. O julgamento do Agravo de Petição se dá como o do Recurso Ordinário, sendo facultado aos advogados das partes a sustentação oral. Em especial, este recurso tem como quesito a impugnação e demonstrar que trará prejuízo à parte, e que, o quanto antes for sanada a divergência, evitará maiores desgastes aos envolvidos. Pode, ainda, favorecer na celeridade processual e encerramento da demanda.},

Text mining refers to the set of tools, techniques, and algorithms adopted to extract useful information from unstructured data. Considering that Portuguese ranks among the ten most spoken languages, and it is the second most common in Twitter, this study aims to map current primary studies that relate to the application of text mining for Portuguese. A systematic mapping method was applied and 6075 primary studies were retrieved up to the year 2014. A total of 203 studies were included, from which more than 60\% analyse texts written in Brazilian variant. The majority of studies focus on the text classification task.

O código-fonte do Processo Judicial Eletrônico (PJe) é permeado de algoritmos que garantem a lisura do procedimento, podendo, inclusive, no que diz respeito à disciplina judiciária e controle das decisões em todos os graus de jurisdição, vir a assegurar que se observem os ditames da Lei 13.015/14 (e.g.art. 896, § 4º, CLT), bem como do Código de Processo Civil (e.g. art. 988, II). Com isso, os julgamentos por precedentes reforçam a segurança jurídica e eficácia da duração razoável do processo (art. 5º, XXXVI e LXXVIII, da Constituição Federal), dando vazão aos milhões de processos pendentes de trânsito em julgado.

This can be useful, for both lawyers and judges, as an assisting tool to rapidly identify cases and extract patterns which lead to certain decisions. This paper presents the first systematic study on predicting the outcome of cases tried by the European Court of Human Rights based solely on textual content. We formulate a binary classification task where the input of our classifiers is the textual content extracted from a case and the target output is the actual judgment as to whether there has been a violation of an article of the convention of human rights. Textual information is represented using contiguous word sequences, i.e., N-grams, and topics. Our models can predict the court’s decisions with a strong accuracy (79\% on average). Our empirical analysis indicates that the formal facts of a case are the most important predictive factor. This is consistent with the theory of legal realism suggesting that judicial decision-making is significantly affected by the stimulus of the facts. We also observe that the topical content of a case is another important feature in this classification task and explore this relationship further by conducting a qualitative analysis.},

The huge amount of judgment documents has witnessed the improvement of judicial justice and openness. Document categorization becomes increasingly important for judgments indexing and further analysis. However, it is almost impossible to categorize them manually due to their large volume and rapid growth. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to automatically classify Chinese judgment documents using machine learning algorithms including Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). A judgment document is represented as vector space model (VSM) using TF-IDF after words segmentation. To improve performance, we construct a set of judicial stop words. Besides, as TF-IDF generates a high dimensional feature vector, which leads to an extremely high time complexity, we utilize three dimensional reduction methods. Based on 6735 pieces of judgment documents, extensive experiments demonstrate the eﬀectiveness and high classiﬁcation performance of our proposed method.},

This study examines the reliability of online hotel reviews in TripAdvisor by developing a text classifier to predict travel purpose (i.e., business vs. leisure) based upon review textual contents. The classifier is tested over a range of cities and data sizes to examine its sensitivity to data samples. The findings show that, while the classifier’s performance is fairly consistent across different sets of cities, there are variations in response to data sizes and sampling methods. More importantly, a considerable amount of noise is found in the data, which leads to misclassification. Furthermore, a novel approach is developed to address the misclassification problem resulting from data noise. This study reveals important data quality issues and contributes to the theoretical foundations of social media analytics in hospitality and tourism.},

The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We also compare the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition.},
